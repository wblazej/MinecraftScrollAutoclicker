# MinecraftScrollAutoclicker
Minecraft scroll autoclicker is program that allows you to set your scroll as right or left mouse click in general. It's useful in Minecraft because there is not feature in game options that sets it.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/wblazej/MinecraftScrollAutoclicker/
cd MinecraftScrollAutoclicker
pip install -r requirements.txt
python minecraft_scroll_autoclicker.py
```

## Usage
Firstly you got to disable scroll in Minecraft settings. To do this, follow steps:<br>
- Go to Controls -> Mouse Settings<br>
- Change Scroll Sensitivity to 0,01<br><br>

Then scroll up (or down, depends how do you see it) and every scroll step will generate one click.<br><br>
Press key **[** to toggle mouse button<br>
Press key **]** to turn off or turn on scroll clicking<br>
Press **Ctrl + C** to terminate the program<br><br>
Technically, there's no chance to detect this software, but do not use this code to cheat on multiplayers game because you can get banned. **Use at your own risk**.

## CPS test
It's depends on you how many cps will this program generate, because you use the scroll. You can scroll fast or slow. But in case of fast scrolling, this program can generate above 100 clicks per second.
